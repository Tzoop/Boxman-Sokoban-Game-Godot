 Here is the complete godot project folder (Godot 3.1 was used).
 
 Because it was done for a game boy game jam it has only 4 colors at the same time and resolution is 160px * 144px.
 the resolution is upscaled 3 times, so it better to see on nowadays monitors.
 
 The game boxman has 16 levels. The levels exist as txt.files in the level folder.

 Boxman was made for the GBJAM 7 https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-7  in august 2019.
